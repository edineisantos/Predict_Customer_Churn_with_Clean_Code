Predict Customer Churn with Clean Code

This script is a part of a project that aims to identify credit card customers
who are most likely to churn. The project as a whole adheres to best coding
practices and engineering standards, including PEP8.

This script can be run either interactively or from the command-line interface
(CLI). It serves as a starting point for running all the data science processes
required for customer churn prediction.

Dataset: The data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.
